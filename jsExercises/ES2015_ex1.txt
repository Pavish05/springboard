What is the difference between var and let?

Variables declared by let are only available inside the block where they're defined. Variables declared by var are available throughout the function in which they're declared.
You can reassign and redeclare with var, but you can not redeclare using the let keyword. You can access a hoisted variable with var. Let creates block scope.

What is hoisting?

It’s the way that we explain how the JS compiler works. Variables are lifting or “hoisted” to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using ***var***, you can access the variable name and it’s undefined value before it is used later on.

Function declarations are also hoisted and can be invoked “before” they are defined in a codebase.
